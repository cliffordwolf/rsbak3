rsbak3 -- Rsync Backup (Version 3)

rsbak3 [-v] {config-file} [config-name...]

The rsbak3 command can be used to backup one host to another
hosts harddisc using rsync. In addition to just using rsync to
keep two filesystems in sync, rsbak3 is doing incremental
backups and saves multi-generational history data.

When rsync is syncing a file, it is re-creating the file under
a 2nd name and moving it over the original name - so it's
"unlinking" hardlinks. rsbak3 is taking advantage of this for
making incremental backups: The old backup is "link-copied" to
a new location (see "cp -al") and then this copy of the
backup-tree is rsynced. So all files which have been modified
get unlinked an re-created and all files which have been
removed will get unlinked in the new tree - but everything
which is left unmodified will stay linked to the original
backup and so doesn't need any additional disc space.

Run "make doc" to build the documentation. Various formats
are generated, but "rsbak3.pdf" is the prettiest.

On Debian you need to "apt-get install docbook docbook-utils"
to install the docbook utilities used by "make doc".
